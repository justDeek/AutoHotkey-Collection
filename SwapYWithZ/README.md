### Swap Y with Z

Swaps the Y key with the Z key, as simple as that.

This is useful for people like me, who often have to use a QWERTZ keyboard layout at work or because other layouts aren't that common, but are used to using a QWERTY layout for programming.

You can also use this script as a basis to swap any two keys on your keyboard.
