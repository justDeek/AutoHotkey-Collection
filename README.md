My personal collection of useful [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) script, which I use on a daily basis; most of them created by myself and some collected from the web. I hope you find some use in them as well.

To see what each script is about, you should check out the README in the respective folder or you can go through the source code to get a grasp of their functionality.

You can either use the scripts directly by running the provided executables, make changes to them to suit your needs, or use them as a reference or starting point to create your own.

## About AutoHotkey

If you're unfamiliar with AutoHotkey, you can find a good introduction [here](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Tutorial.htm) and for code references, check out the [docs](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v2/) or the [community forum](https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/).

In short: AutoHotkey is a scripting language that allows you to automate tasks and add custom keyboard shortcuts to your system. It's very powerful and easy to use.

## Usage

Each script is self-contained and can be used independently. Each folder contains both the script file and a compiled executable, as well as icons to be used as the thumbnail for the exe. The compiled executable can be used without installing AutoHotkey.

## Making Changes

To make changes to the scripts, you should first install AutoHotkey, so you can run the scripts directly from the source code (the .ahk file). You can download AutoHotkey from [here](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/).

After installation you should be able to open the .ahk files, which either shows any compilation errors or successfully adds the script to the system tray.

You can then make changes to the script and reload it by right-clicking the AutoHotkey icon in the system tray and selecting `Reload This Script`.

## Compiling

If you want to compile the scripts yourself, either because you made some changes or you don't trust executables from external sources, you can download and install AutoHotkey and compile them yourself by following [this guide](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v2/Scripts.htm#ahk2exe) or just right-clicking on the desired .ahk file and selecting `Compile Script (GUI)`.

## Run Executables on Startup

(Guide for Windows:)\
If you want to run the compiled executables on startup, you can create a shortcut to the executable and place it in the startup folder.

The startup folder can be accessed by pressing `Win + R` and typing `shell:startup`.
