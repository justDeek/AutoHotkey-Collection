### Alt Remapper

A script that improves navigating around the content of text editors and IDE by adding keyboard shortcuts related to holding down the Alt or Ctrl Key and pressing other keys like the arrow keys.

This allows for quickly and easily moving the caret to the left or right, to the start or end of the current line, moving the current line up or down either one line, two lines or to the beginning or end of the file, selecting the characters or words next to the caret, selecting or cutting out the current line, and more.
